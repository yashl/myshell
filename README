Welcome to my shell! This shell handles several commands, including handling piping and reading input from std:in and from a file stream.

In order to include it from a file stream, you will have to make a .txt file have that as your second argument to the shell.
For example: "./myshell inputfile.txt"

For piping, "ls -l|more" is supported
